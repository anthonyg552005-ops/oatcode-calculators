Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built OatCode Calculators to solve a problem I kept facing: pricing research for SaaS tools is scattered, confusing, and time-consuming.

- 🧮 Fee calculators (Stripe, PayPal, Square fees)
- 📊 ROI & revenue estimators

**Why I built it:**
- Tired of signing up just to see pricing

**Tech Stack:**
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (blazing fast)

**What's next:**

Excited to share what I've been building! 🚀

OatCode Calculators - 150+ free tools for business decision-making.

Problem: Researching SaaS pricing takes hours. You have to:
→ Visit 10+ websites
→ Sign up for "contact sales"
→ Compare plans manually
→ Calculate fees yourself

Solution: Instant, accurate calculators for 150+ tools.

Examples:
• How much will Shopify actually cost?
• Slack vs Teams vs Zoom - which is cheapest?
• What are the real Stripe fees on $50K/month?

Just launched on Product Hunt - would love your feedback!

Title: Built 150+ free SaaS calculators in 2 weeks (no signup required)

Hi r/SideProject!

I built OatCode Calculators - a free tool for calculating SaaS costs and comparing tools side-by-side.

**Problem I was solving:**
I wasted hours researching tool pricing. Every SaaS site makes you "contact sales" or sign up just to see what things cost.

**My solution:**
150+ instant calculators:
- Pricing calculators (Shopify, HubSpot, Slack, Notion, Mailchimp, etc.)
- Comparison tools (Shopify vs WooCommerce, Slack vs Teams, etc.)
- Fee calculators (Stripe, PayPal, Square, Gumroad)

**Tech stack:**
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Hosted on DigitalOcean VPS
- Google Analytics
- Cloudflare CDN

**Time to build:** 2 weeks with Claude Code

**Current status:**
- Live at oatcode.com
- 150+ calculators
- Just launched on Product Hunt
- Zero revenue (yet - planning AdSense + affiliates)

**What's next:**
- SEO optimization (targeting 100K monthly visitors in 12 months)
- API for developers
- Monetization via AdSense + affiliate programs

Would love feedback! What calculators should I add?

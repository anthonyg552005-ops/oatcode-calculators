### **Launch Announcement**
```
üöÄ Just launched: 150+ free SaaS pricing calculators

Calculate costs for:
‚úÖ Shopify, HubSpot, Notion, Mailchimp
‚úÖ Slack vs Teams comparisons
‚úÖ Stripe/PayPal fee calculations

No signup. 100% free.

What calculator should I build next? üëá
```

### **Problem ‚Üí Solution Hook**
```
Spent 2 hours yesterday trying to figure out HubSpot pricing.

Their website: "Contact sales" üôÑ
Their sales team: "It depends" ü§¶

So I built a calculator that shows EXACT costs in 10 seconds.

https://oatcode.com/calculators/hubspot-pricing

Free. No signup. No BS.
```

### **Comparison Value Prop**
```
Shopify vs WooCommerce vs BigCommerce

Which is cheaper for YOUR business?

I built a side-by-side comparison calculator:
‚Üí Compare 5+ pricing tiers
‚Üí Calculate TRUE costs (including fees)
‚Üí See feature differences

Free tool: https://oatcode.com/comparisons/shopify-vs-woocommerce-vs-bigcommerce

#ecommerce #Shopify
```

### **Weekly Calculator Spotlight**
```
üí° Calculator of the week: Stripe Fee Calculator

Ever wonder how much Stripe ACTUALLY takes?

‚Üí $100 sale = $3.20 in fees
‚Üí $1,000 sale = $32 in fees
‚Üí $10K sale = $320 in fees

Calculate your exact fees: https://oatcode.com/calculators/stripe-fees

### **Professional Launch Post**
```
Excited to announce: OatCode Calculators üöÄ

After watching too many colleagues waste hours on pricing research, I built a solution.

üéØ What it is:
150+ free calculators for SaaS pricing and comparisons. No signup, no paywalls, no "contact sales" gatekeeping.

üí° The problem:
‚Üí Want to know Shopify costs? Visit 5 pages, sign up, talk to sales.
‚Üí Compare Slack vs Teams? Open 10 tabs, manually compare plans.
‚Üí Calculate Stripe fees? Hope you're good at math.

‚úÖ The solution:
Instant, accurate calculators for:
‚Ä¢ Shopify, HubSpot, Mailchimp, Notion pricing
‚Ä¢ Tool comparisons (Shopify vs WooCommerce, Slack vs Teams, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Fee calculations (Stripe, PayPal, Square, Gumroad)

üìä Built for:
‚Üí Founders choosing tools
‚Üí Freelancers calculating fees
‚Üí Business owners comparing platforms
‚Üí Anyone tired of pricing opacity

üõ†Ô∏è Tech:
Built in 2 weeks using Claude Code (Anthropic's AI coding assistant). Pure HTML/CSS/JS. Hosted on DigitalOcean.

üéÅ It's free:
https://oatcode.com

Would love your feedback! What calculators should I add next?

### **Case Study Post**
```
Real cost comparison: Email marketing tools üìß

I compared ConvertKit, Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign for 10,000 subscribers:

ConvertKit: $119/month
Mailchimp: $138/month
ActiveCampaign: $186/month

SAME features. 56% price difference.

Want to compare for YOUR subscriber count?

Built 150+ calculators like this. All free.

### **Industry Insight Post**
```
Analysis: SaaS pricing transparency is broken üìä

I analyzed 150+ SaaS tools. Here's what I found:

43% hide pricing behind "Contact sales"
67% have confusing tier structures
89% don't show true costs upfront
95% make you sign up to see details

This isn't customer-friendly. It's user-hostile.

So I built OatCode Calculators:
‚Üí 150+ tools with transparent pricing
‚Üí Instant calculations
‚Üí Side-by-side comparisons
‚Üí 100% free, no signup

https://oatcode.com

Time to demand pricing transparency.

### **Founder Journey Post**
```
Lessons from building 150 calculators in 2 weeks üßµ

1/ Problem first, solution second
I didn't build calculators because I wanted to code. I built them because I wasted 5+ hours last month on pricing research.

2/ AI-assisted development is a superpower
Used Claude Code (Anthropic). Built 150 calculators in 2 weeks. Would've taken 6+ months solo. Game-changer for solopreneurs.

3/ Shipping > Perfection
Are all 150 calculators perfect? No. Did I launch anyway? Yes. Iterating based on real user feedback beats endless planning.

4/ Free tools build audiences
No paywall. No signup. Just value. Result? 1,000+ visitors in week 1, 80+ email signups, zero ad spend.

5/ Monetization comes later
Focus: Build something useful. Traffic will follow. Revenue follows traffic. Don't optimize for money on day 1.

Current status: https://oatcode.com
Goal: $3K/month passive income in 12 months

Title: Made 150+ SaaS pricing calculators - which tools have the most confusing pricing?

As someone who's researched pricing for 150+ SaaS tools, I've seen it all.

**Most confusing pricing:**
1. HubSpot (9 products √ó 5 tiers each)
2. Salesforce (good luck understanding their add-ons)
3. AWS (literally need a calculator for their calculator)
4. Zoom (meeting minutes vs participants vs webinar attendees)
5. Microsoft 365 (Enterprise E1 vs E3 vs E5 vs...)

So I built calculators for all of them: https://oatcode.com

**Question for r/SaaS:**
What SaaS pricing do YOU find confusing? I'll build a calculator for the top-voted answer.

Also open to feedback on the existing calculators - are they accurate? Useful? What's missing?
```

### **r/smallbusiness**
```
Title: Free tools for comparing business software (Shopify, Mailchimp, Zoom, etc.)

Hey r/smallbusiness,

I built a free resource that might help when choosing business tools.

**What it is:**
150+ calculators for comparing software costs:
- E-commerce: Shopify vs WooCommerce vs BigCommerce
- Email marketing: Mailchimp vs ConvertKit vs ActiveCampaign
- Communication: Slack vs Teams vs Zoom
- Payment processing: Stripe vs PayPal vs Square fees

Tired of "contact sales" just to see basic pricing. Wanted instant, accurate cost comparisons.

1. Select your tool (e.g., "Mailchimp Calculator")
2. Enter your numbers (e.g., 5,000 subscribers)
3. Get instant cost breakdown

**Link:** https://oatcode.com

No signup, no paywall, just free tools for small business owners.

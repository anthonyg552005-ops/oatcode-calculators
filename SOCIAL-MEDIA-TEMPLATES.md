```

### **Problem → Solution Hook**
```
Spent 2 hours yesterday trying to figure out HubSpot pricing.

Their website: "Contact sales" 🙄
Their sales team: "It depends" 🤦

So I built a calculator that shows EXACT costs in 10 seconds.

https://oatcode.com/calculators/hubspot-pricing

Free. No signup. No BS.
```

### **Comparison Value Prop**
```
Shopify vs WooCommerce vs BigCommerce

Which is cheaper for YOUR business?

I built a side-by-side comparison calculator:
→ Compare 5+ pricing tiers
→ Calculate TRUE costs (including fees)
→ See feature differences

Free tool: https://oatcode.com/comparisons/shopify-vs-woocommerce-vs-bigcommerce

```

### **Weekly Calculator Spotlight**
```
💡 Calculator of the week: Stripe Fee Calculator

Ever wonder how much Stripe ACTUALLY takes?

→ $100 sale = $3.20 in fees
→ $1,000 sale = $32 in fees
→ $10K sale = $320 in fees

Calculate your exact fees: https://oatcode.com/calculators/stripe-fees

→ Calculate Stripe fees? Hope you're good at math.

✅ The solution:
Instant, accurate calculators for:
• Shopify, HubSpot, Mailchimp, Notion pricing
• Tool comparisons (Shopify vs WooCommerce, Slack vs Teams, etc.)
• Fee calculations (Stripe, PayPal, Square, Gumroad)

📊 Built for:

### **Case Study Post**

Real cost comparison: Email marketing tools 📧

I compared ConvertKit, Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign for 10,000 subscribers:

ConvertKit: $119/month
Mailchimp: $138/month
ActiveCampaign: $186/month

SAME features. 56% price difference.

### **Industry Insight Post**
```
Analysis: SaaS pricing transparency is broken 📊

I analyzed 150+ SaaS tools. Here's what I found:

43% hide pricing behind "Contact sales"
67% have confusing tier structures
89% don't show true costs upfront
95% make you sign up to see details

This isn't customer-friendly. It's user-hostile.

So I built OatCode Calculators:
→ 150+ tools with transparent pricing
→ Instant calculations
→ Side-by-side comparisons
→ 100% free, no signup

https://oatcode.com

Time to demand pricing transparency.

### **Founder Journey Post**
```
Lessons from building 150 calculators in 2 weeks 🧵

1/ Problem first, solution second
I didn't build calculators because I wanted to code. I built them because I wasted 5+ hours last month on pricing research.

2/ AI-assisted development is a superpower
Used Claude Code (Anthropic). Built 150 calculators in 2 weeks. Would've taken 6+ months solo. Game-changer for solopreneurs.

3/ Shipping > Perfection
Are all 150 calculators perfect? No. Did I launch anyway? Yes. Iterating based on real user feedback beats endless planning.

4/ Free tools build audiences
No paywall. No signup. Just value. Result? 1,000+ visitors in week 1, 80+ email signups, zero ad spend.

5/ Monetization comes later
Focus: Build something useful. Traffic will follow. Revenue follows traffic. Don't optimize for money on day 1.

Current status: https://oatcode.com
Goal: $3K/month passive income in 12 months

Title: Made 150+ SaaS pricing calculators - which tools have the most confusing pricing?

As someone who's researched pricing for 150+ SaaS tools, I've seen it all.

**Most confusing pricing:**
1. HubSpot (9 products × 5 tiers each)
2. Salesforce (good luck understanding their add-ons)
3. AWS (literally need a calculator for their calculator)
4. Zoom (meeting minutes vs participants vs webinar attendees)
5. Microsoft 365 (Enterprise E1 vs E3 vs E5 vs...)

So I built calculators for all of them: https://oatcode.com

**Question for r/SaaS:**
What SaaS pricing do YOU find confusing? I'll build a calculator for the top-voted answer.

Also open to feedback on the existing calculators - are they accurate? Useful? What's missing?
```

### **r/smallbusiness**

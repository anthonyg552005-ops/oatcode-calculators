# ðŸŽ¯ 100 CALCULATOR STRATEGY - Zero Effort, Maximum Revenue

**Growth Operator:** Claude (Final Decision)
**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Goal:** $2,000/month with ZERO ongoing effort
**Method:** 100 calculators, SEO traffic, AdSense + Affiliates
**Timeline:** 12-18 months

---

## ðŸ’¡ THE KEY INSIGHT: Affiliates > AdSense

**Current thinking:**
- Build 100 calculators â†’ Get traffic â†’ AdSense pays $5 per 1,000 visitors
- 100,000 visitors Ã— $5 CPM = $500/month
- **Not enough to hit $2k**

**Growth operator thinking:**
- Build 100 calculators â†’ Get traffic â†’ AdSense + HIGH-COMMISSION affiliates
- Focus on calculators where we can add $20-100/month affiliate revenue per calculator
- Example: Notion calculator â†’ Link to Notion affiliate â†’ $10 per signup
- 1,000 visitors Ã— 1% click Ã— 10% convert = 1 signup = $10
- That's $10 per 1,000 visitors (2x AdSense)

**The shift:**
- Don't just build random calculators
- Build calculators for products/services with AFFILIATE PROGRAMS
- Especially auto-approval programs (zero effort)

## ðŸ’° THE NEW MATH

### 100 Calculators Optimized for Affiliates

**Mix:**
- 40 calculators: SaaS/Software tools (high affiliate commissions)
- 30 calculators: Freelance/Creator economy (medium commissions)
- 20 calculators: E-commerce/Services (medium commissions)
- 10 calculators: Pure traffic (AdSense only)

**Revenue per 1,000 visitors (by type):**

**SaaS Calculators (40):**
- Notion, Airtable, Webflow, Figma, etc.
- Affiliate: $10-30 per 1,000 visitors
- AdSense: $5 per 1,000 visitors
- Total: $15-35 per 1,000 visitors

**Creator Economy (30):**
- Substack, Patreon, Gumroad, etc.
- Affiliate: $5-15 per 1,000 visitors
- AdSense: $5 per 1,000 visitors
- Total: $10-20 per 1,000 visitors

**E-commerce/Services (20):**
- Shopify, Printful, Etsy tools, etc.
- Affiliate: $8-20 per 1,000 visitors
- AdSense: $5 per 1,000 visitors
- Total: $13-25 per 1,000 visitors

**Pure Traffic (10):**
- Discord, random tools
- AdSense only: $5 per 1,000 visitors

**Blended average: $12-22 per 1,000 visitors**

**Compare to AdSense only: $5 per 1,000 visitors**

**That's 2.4x to 4.4x better revenue!**

## ðŸ’° REVENUE PROJECTION (100 Calculators)

### Conservative Scenario
- 100 calculators built
- 60 rank well (60% success)
- 60 Ã— 1,200 visitors/month = 72,000 visitors
- Revenue: 72,000 Ã— $12/1,000 = $864/month

**Not quite $2k yet...**

### Realistic Scenario
- 100 calculators built
- 70 rank well (70% success)
- 70 Ã— 1,500 visitors/month = 105,000 visitors
- Revenue: 105,000 Ã— $15/1,000 = **$1,575/month**

**Close to $2k!**

### Optimistic Scenario
- 100 calculators built
- 75 rank well (75% success)
- 75 Ã— 1,800 visitors/month = 135,000 visitors
- Revenue: 135,000 Ã— $17/1,000 = **$2,295/month**

**Over $2k! âœ…**

### After 18-24 Months (Traffic Compounds)
- Same 70-75 ranking calculators
- But now 2,000-3,000 visitors each (SEO compounds)
- 75 Ã— 2,500 = 187,500 visitors
- Revenue: 187,500 Ã— $16/1,000 = **$3,000/month**

**Timeline to $2k: 12-18 months**

- Auto-payment to bank
- Set once, run forever

### 3. Simple Implementation
```html
<!-- Example: Notion Calculator -->

  <a href="https://notion.so?ref=YOURID" target="_blank">
    Try Notion Free â†’
  </a>
  <!-- That's it. Gets commission automatically -->
</div>
```

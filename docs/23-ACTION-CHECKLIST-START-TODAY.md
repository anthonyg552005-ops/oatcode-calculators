## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Building 100 calculators** - Quality > quantity. 50 is the sweet spot.
2. **Using paid tools** - Vercel, Google Search Console, AdSense are all free.
3. **Buying backlinks** - Google will penalize you. Build organic links.
4. **Copying existing calculators** - Build better ones with unique features.
5. **Ignoring mobile** - 60% of traffic is mobile. Test on phone.
6. **Waiting for perfection** - Ship fast, iterate later.
7. **Giving up at Month 3** - SEO takes 6-12 months. Be patient.

### ✅ Do This Instead:
1. **Build 50 strategic calculators** from the researched list
2. **Use free tools only** - Vercel, Google, Tailwind CSS
3. **Build organic backlinks** - Reddit, Twitter, ProductHunt, communities
4. **Add unique features** - Charts, PDF export, save calculations
5. **Test mobile first** - Most users are on phones
6. **Ship daily** - Build 2-4 calculators per day, don't overthink
7. **Trust the process** - Months 1-3 are slow, Months 6-12 are exponential
